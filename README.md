## Window Management Library
WINX is a simple to use, minimal, cross-platform and single-header window management C library designed to easily create an OpenGL 3.0+ compatible window on both Windows and Linux (as well as on MacOS through X11).

#### Example
To see WINX in action run the `build.sh` (or `./build.bat` on Windows) script to compile and execute a simple OpenGL program using a WINX created context and window.

#### Docs
Documentation describing the basics of using WINX can be found at the beginning of the `winx.h` header file, just under the license.
